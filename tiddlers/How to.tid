To use this wiki you can either 

* Search for the name of the inequality directly in the search bar
* Search the inequality "by tags" by going to [[Search]], in the tab "Locator by tags", then click on the plus in front of the tags in the expendable tags list to narrow the search.


Go to [[https://inequalitieswiki.herokuapp.com/login-basic]] to log in as a writer if you got the credentials. Then, to contribute, you can add your own inequality. Use the add inequality" (logo â‰¤ situated on the right sidebar). Don't forget to add tags describing the main components of the inequality (look at other inequalities for inspiration).
