# Statement of the inequality
Let $X$ be a non-negative real random variable with finite expectation. Then for any $t>0$, 
$$\P(X > t ) \le \frac{\E[X]}{t} $$

More generally, if $\varphi$ is a non-negative, non increasing function from $\R$ to $\R_+$. Then, 
$$\P(X > t ) \le \frac{\E[\varphi(X)]}{\varphi(t)}.$$
