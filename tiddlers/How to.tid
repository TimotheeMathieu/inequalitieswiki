To use this wiki you can either 

* Search for the name of the inequality directly in the search bar
* Search the inequality "by tags" by going to [[Search]], in the tab "Locator by tags", then click on the plus in front of the tags in the expendable tags list to narrow the search.

To contribute, you can add your own inequality. Use the add inequality" (logo â‰¤ situated on the right sidebar). Don't forget to add tags describing the main components of the inequality (look at other inequalities for inspiration).
