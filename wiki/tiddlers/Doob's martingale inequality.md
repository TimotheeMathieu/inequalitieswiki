# Statement of the inequality

We suppose that $X$ is a submartingale taking real values, either in discrete or continuous time. That is, for all times $s$ and $t$ with $s < t$,
$X_s ≤ \E[ X_t ∣ F_s ]$ (For a continuous-time submartingale, assume further that the process is càdlàg.)

Let X be a submartingale then, for any $\varepsilon>0$, 
$$\P\left(\max_{1\le t\le T} X_t > \varepsilon \right)\le > \frac{\E[\max(0,X_t)]}{\varepsilon}.$$
